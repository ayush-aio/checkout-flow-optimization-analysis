# Checkout Flow Optimization Analysis (SQL, Tableau)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce checkout funnel to identify where users drop off during the checkout process and how conversion rates can be improved. The analysis focuses on understanding user behavior across multiple checkout stages and delivering data-driven recommendations to optimize purchase completion.

---

## Business Problem
Checkout abandonment is one of the biggest challenges in e-commerce. Even small inefficiencies in the checkout flow can lead to significant revenue loss.  
The goal of this project is to identify critical drop-off points in the checkout process and propose actionable improvements.

## Dataset Description
- User-level checkout session data
- Each record represents a user interaction at a checkout stage
- Multiple stages including cart, address, payment, and confirmation

---

## Analysis Performed

### SQL Analysis
- Analyzed 40k+ checkout sessions
- Calculated step-wise conversion and abandonment rates
- Identified key friction points with 20–25% drop-off at payment stages
- Segmented user behavior across checkout steps

### Tableau Visualization
- Built an interactive checkout funnel dashboard
- Visualized user progression and drop-offs
- Highlighted bottlenecks impacting conversion efficiency

---

## Key Insights
- The payment stage showed the highest abandonment rate
- Minor friction at late checkout stages has a disproportionate impact on overall conversion
- Optimizing checkout flow could potentially improve completion rates by 5–10%

---

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates how funnel analytics and visualization can be used to identify revenue-impacting issues in product flows. The insights from this project can help businesses improve user experience and increase conversions through targeted checkout optimizations.
